# work-day-scheduler
for this project we created a daily planner and for mine i came up with this:

![header displaying current time and list of hours in the day with ext field and save button](Assets/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-01%20at%209.21.23%20pm.png)

with this you can easily select each hour of the day and add any comments or activities you need to do for that hour and press save so even if you refresh you will still have your reminder there.

this was a great project as it will hopefully help plan out my days and set dedicated time to homework and just stay organised.

this one took me a bit to do as i found myself using half Jquery and half basic javascript which didnt always work but after a bit of guidence managed to clean it up and have a nice displaying day planner.

if you would like to try this day planner you can follow this link: https://andrewdippel.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

ive also added some basic screen management so if you are using this on your phone it will still work and look like this:
